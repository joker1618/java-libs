*** JkRepo ***

DESCRIPTION:

Framework to manage the data layer.

To create a class manageable from the framework:
- the class must extends 'RepoEntity'
- every field managed must be annotated with @EntityField or @EntityPK or @ForeignID
- one or more fields must be annotated with 'EntityPK' (see constraints below)

PRIMARY KEY
The PK of an entity is very important: equals(), hashcode() and compareTo() methods use the it

It is created as follow:
A) if the class is annotated with @NoPrimaryKey the entity ID will be used as a PK
B) else the fields annotated with @EntityPK will be used

Constraint:
1. if @NoPrimaryKey is used, the used of @EntityPK is denied (and viceversa)
2. A field @EntityPK must be of SIMPLE type

Important:
*** @EntityPK used with null fields will cause a problem

DEPENDENCIES

- For struct types that have as a generic child a RepoEntity:
    1. Collections must be of RepoEntity (no nested Collection/Map)
    2. Map must have a key of simple type, and a value of simple type or Collection<simple type>
